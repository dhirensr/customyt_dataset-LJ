1-out||We take off now from last semester where we left off with quantum physics this semester.
2-out||Before we begin the course proper, I would like to get a little background from you on
3-out||what you already know, how we should run this course, what the modalities are and so on.
4-out||As far as the evaluation is concerned, it's the usual two quizzes and a final exam. Philosophical
5-out||and interpretational aspects of quantum mechanics are still open in the sense that, all questions
6-out||have not been answered. In spite of over a hundred years of effort, there are unresolved
7-out||questions, there are deep mysteries, and there are central mysteries and issues. Some of
8-out||them may turn out in the future to be non-questions in the sense that, you yourself may turn out
9-out||to be asking the wrong question and so on. But at the operational level, it's actually
10-out||easier than classical physics. The mathematics is simpler than classical mechanics, for instance,
11-out||and it works over a huge wide range of phenomena.
12-out||As far as we know, there are no violations of quantum mechanics. What we don't know
13-out||is its interpretation to complete satisfaction. We don't know if it's a complete theory,
14-out||we don't know if it will answer all questions and so on and so forth. But certainly as a
15-out||calculational device, it's extremely successful and as a way of understanding natural phenomena,
16-out||it seems to be the most basic of all subjects, in the sense that, everything at the ultimate
17-out||level turns out to obey quantum mechanics.
18-out||So with that kind of a very sketchy preamble, let me go on to state a few properties in
19-out||quantum mechanics. Depending on what the response is, whether it's familiar or not and so
20-out||on, I start as writing down the formulism. Because otherwise I could start by simply
21-out||saying the postulates of quantum mechanics are as follows and as we go along, when things
22-out||become inconvenient, I add one more postulate and then we go on and so forth and then you
23-out||just say this is a set and that's it, these are the rules and so on. I shouldn't want
24-out||to do that Since it is a conceptually very rich subject, I would like to find out what
25-out||it is that you know, what you don't know and so on before we decide how to approach
26-out||this subject.
27-out||Now the first point about quantum mechanics is that, all of you have heard that quantum
28-out||mechanics applies in the microscopic domain. It applies to electrons, atoms and things
29-out||of atomic sizes. This is only partly true. It applies to everything. It applies to human
30-out||beings, galaxies, the universe presumably, electrons, photons and so on. It is just that
31-out||the manifestations of quantum mechanics become very dramatic when you look at extremely small
32-out||objects. They become even more dramatic when you look at extremely small objects moving
33-out||very fast relativistically. So, that's the reason why one feels that quantum mechanics
34-out||is applicable only in the microscopic domain. Not true. It's applied everywhere. It has
35-out||some manifestations which are very dramatic even in real life, even in the macroscopic
36-out||domain. For instance, my favorite example is the fact that solids are rigid objects.
37-out||The fact that I don't go through the floor here, the fact that matter doesn't penetrate
38-out||itself is due to quantum mechanics. It's due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle which
39-out||follows from quantum mechanics. So there are these very deep consequences. The phenomena
40-out||you are used to in daily life like magnetism or electrical conduction or the propagation
41-out||of sound in solids are all quantum phenomena.
42-out||Not just super fluids, super conductors and so on which are given as usual examples of
43-out||microscopic quantum mechanics but even ordinary phenomena like electrical conduction, the
44-out||conduction of sound in solids, magnetism, the existence of permanent magnets, the existence
45-out||of diamagnets, paramagnets etc depend on quantum mechanical principles widely. They are not
46-out||explainable classically.
47-out||You know that in the early days of quantum mechanics, there were several ways in which
48-out||people found that classical physics failed. One of them was the black body radiation.
49-out||So the very fact that collection of photons behaves quantum mechanically is an obvious
50-out||instance where you have quantum mechanics for large systems. When you go to the atomic
51-out||domain, one of the consequences of quantum mechanics become very apparent and it's
52-out||called the uncertainty principle.
53-out||Now I should like to find out from you what you know about the uncertainty principle.
54-out||What's the uncertainty principle? Let me take one statement at a time. The position
55-out||and momentum cannot be simultaneously and accurately measured. So we will make this
56-out||precise now. Position and momentum of what? Any particle One particle, two particles,
57-out||a system? Well, let's assume that systems are made up of particles. We have individual
58-out||particles and let's look at the given particle, an individual particle. Now let's take the
59-out||statement word by word.
60-out||Simultaneously means at the same mathematical instant of time and by accurately, to what
61-out||precision? To arbitrary precision, to infinite precision in principle. Cannot be measured.
62-out||Now what does that mean? That means a failure of experiment? Is it just that we don't
63-out||have a good enough piece of equipment? It's a property. It's fundamental. It's more
64-out||than just a statement about measurement. It's nothing to do with measuring apparatus although
65-out||that's the way it's normally looked at. The position and momentum cannot even be precisely
66-out||defined for such objects at a given instant of time.
67-out||The property of momentum and the property of position cannot exist, in the sense of
68-out||being measurable with infinite precision at a given instant of time. So it is not a failure
69-out||of experiment. It's not a failure or a lack of resolution or technology. It's an intrinsic
70-out||property of nature for these objects. Now what sort position and what sort of momentum?
71-out||Is it linear momentum? Angular momentum? Position I understand. Canonically conjugate. We already
72-out||looked classically at canonically conjugate variables. It's the same thing. Canonically
73-out||conjugate coordinate and momentum are pairs. They would obey an uncertainty principle.
74-out||What about the x component of the position of a particle and the y component of the momentum?
75-out||Do they satisfy an uncertainty principle? They don't since they are not canonically
76-out||conjugate to each other. x with px, y with py and so on are canonically conjugate variables.
77-out||What about  non-cartesian coordinates?
78-out||What about, for example, the radial distance in spherical polar coordinates in some coordinate
79-out||system from the origin of a particle and the radial component of the momentum along the
80-out||radius vector? These two are canonically conjugate to each other and it's these two which in
81-out||quantum mechanics would satisfy an uncertainty principle. If they are not canonical conjugate,
82-out||this is not true. So already you begin to see that the framework of classical Hamiltonian
83-out||mechanics is being translated into quantum mechanics.
84-out||So Hamiltonian's play a very special role and the whole assumption is that you already
85-out||have a Hamiltonian for a system and you have the Hamiltonian framework of classical mechanics
86-out||and then you translate to quantum mechanics. The question of how do you do quantum mechanics
87-out||for systems which are not Hamiltonian in the classical limit is a much deeper and much
88-out||harder question which would not be addressed in this course. It's not at all clear how
89-out||one would do this. In particular, this immediately means that if you have dissipation in a system,
90-out||classically you know that it cannot be an autonomous Hamiltonian system. Then you run
91-out||into trouble and the corresponding quantum mechanics is not clear at all. It doesn't
92-out||mean friction doesn't exist. It's just that the extension of the usual formalism
93-out||of quantum mechanics to these dissipative cases is not straight forward and the problem
94-out||of dissipation in quantum mechanics is still an open problem. The question of what happens
95-out||in open systems which exchange energy and momentum and so on with the surroundings is
96-out||still an open problem. In that sense, the quantum mechanics we are going to do is really
97-out||very elementary for systems which are essentially going to be at absolute zero of temperature.
98-out||So we won't bring in temperature and systems which don't have any dissipation at all,
99-out||till fairly late in the course. So it's for those kinds of coordinates in momentum
100-out||that you have the uncertainty principle. Now what does the uncertainty principle actually
101-out||say?
102-out||Let's look at x and px for a particle. This is a canonically conjugate pair. Classically
103-out||I know that this is equal to 1. In the sense of Poisson brackets, this is 1 if I look at
104-out||a single particle and I say x is a generalized coordinate and px is a corresponding conjugate
105-out||momentum, the Poisson bracket of x with px is 1. Now there is a similar relation written
106-out||down quantum mechanically. What does the uncertainty principle actually say?
107-out||It says that delta x times delta px is greater than or equal to h cross over 2. This is certainly
108-out||true. h cross is what I use for h over 2 pi . h is the Planck's constant. This is an
109-out||experimental fact. This has been around now since 1925 or so and has not been contested.
110-out||I should like to first find out from you what you mean by delta x.
111-out||Now what do you mean by uncertainty? Is it the least count of some ruler or measuring
112-out||device? It cannot be the least count. Well, in principle if I have a sufficiently good
113-out||microscope or an accurate length measuring device with an arbitrarily good least count,
114-out||I can measure position to arbitrary accuracy. So what do you mean by delta x?
115-out||I make many measurements and take the standard deviation of them but I can still improve
116-out||the standard deviation by making many more measurements. Thus we come to the fact that
117-out||it's not definable with arbitrary precision. A particle of this kind we are talking about,
118-out||cannot have a sharp value of its position and its conjugate momentum, be it any state
119-out||of the particle. So it has nothing to do with the precision of the ruler or your experimental
120-out||measuring device. This is well beyond all that. The quantity delta x is a standard deviation.
121-out||So it says that you take your measuring device, no matter how accurate it is and continue
122-out||making these measurements. You would still find a standard deviation no matter how many
123-out||measurements you make and that standard deviation is delta x.
124-out||Now obviously you need a calculational device for delta x. There is a rule which helps you
125-out||to calculate this delta x and similarly for delta px. The moment I say standard deviation,
126-out||I have to define a probability distribution so as to find the standard deviation with
127-out||respect to that probability distribution. The whole point of quantum mechanics is that
128-out||it should tell you what those probability distributions are. The equation which a quantity
129-out||related to the probability distribution satisfies is called the Schrödinger equation.
130-out||This quantity which you call the wave function, which we will introduce shortly, will help
131-out||you calculate the probability distribution and after you find the distribution, you compute
132-out||the average. Formally, standard deviation is defined as x square minus x average square
133-out||to the power half. x square minus x average square to the power half is the variance and
134-out||the square root of the variance is a standard deviation. The only difference is that when
135-out||you normally do classical experiments or take any statistical quantity and measure it repeatedly,
136-out||we obtain a certain histogram.
137-out||In quantum mechanics, the angular brackets refer to averages with respect to a quantum
138-out||mechanical probability distribution. That distribution will be specified through the
139-out||Schrodinger equation. Once you do that, the uncertainty principle is certainly true. In
140-out||practice, the uncertainty principle for a physical particle will find you an answer
141-out||which is very much bigger than h cross over two. The reason is, over and above the quantum
142-out||mechanical uncertainty, which is intrinsic in nature, there would be other uncertainties
143-out||such as, the fact that the system is in contact with surroundings, thermal agitations, noise,
144-out||vibrations, other perturbations from outside, a passing comet that will change your apparatus
145-out||a bit, etc would add up on top of quantum mechanical uncertainty. But in its pristine
146-out||form, the inequality in the uncertainty principle is the quantum mechanical product of quantum
147-out||uncertainties, calculated in a very precise way. Notice it's an inequality, which means
148-out||that it is conceivable that you can arrange matter such that it's an equality. That's
149-out||the least value it could take. It could never become less than a certain non-zero positive
150-out||quantity and of course you know that this is extremely small, in the units we are normally
151-out||used to. That's the reason you don't see this very often unless you go to microscopic
152-out||objects because h cross over 2 here, is of order 10 to the -- 34 in the standard international
153-out||units.
154-out||Since microscopic objects like a piece of chalk or a person or a rock, the energy involved
155-out||is of the order of joules or tens of joules, and that's ten to the power minus thirty
156-out||four joules, you don't see quantum uncertainties unless the objects themselves are extremely
157-out||small, moving extremely fast.
158-out||Now this is just one form of this principle and it's an inequality whereas quantum mechanics
159-out||is a very fairly precise subject in the sense that it will give you equalities always. So
160-out||this inequality is a very weak form of quantum mechanics. It definitely cannot be violated
161-out||but in any given situation, you should be able to actually calculate what's delta
162-out||x, delta px and find out what the right hand side is. So you don't need the inequalities.
163-out||Just that no matter what you do, this cannot be violated.
164-out||Incidentally is it possible to have delta x arbitrarily small from this inequality?
165-out||Yes, but the price you pay for it would be that delta px would become proportionately
166-out||large. we are going derive this we are going to derive this inequality from the Schrodinger
167-out||equation from the postulates of quantum mechanics one of which would be the Schodinger equation
168-out||we would derive this your this inequality here um it's a fairly straight forward thing
169-out||Incidentally this is not the most general form of the inequality. You should immediately
170-out||ask what if I have two arbitrary canonically conjugate dynamical variables. Is there a
171-out||Poisson bracket? Is there an uncertainty principle between them? The answer is yes. You could
172-out||in fact ask if I have two physical quantities, doesn't have to be position and momentum,
173-out||two physical quantities associated with any object, can I write the product of uncertainties.
174-out||The answer is yes you could. It's going to be generalized.
175-out||What I meant by we can derive is that, no matter what experiment you do, the inequality
176-out||is never violated. So in that sense, it's an experimental fact. However, we know why
177-out||that is so because from the postulates of quantum mechanics, this follows as a consequence
178-out||and is verified. So it essentially says that we verified quantum mechanics or the predictions
179-out||of quantum mechanics. You can never verify a theory. You can only verify its predictions.
180-out||Incidentally, this is not the most general way of looking at it. It will turn out  that Poisson brackets for physical quantities
181-out||or canonical variables are replaced in quantum mechanics by operators. We will discuss this
182-out||in great detail .Once you have operators on the right hand side; you need to know what
183-out||do you mean by expectation values or average values of these operators. We will go through
184-out||that in detail.
185-out||It will turn out that if you had any physical quantity A, and any other physical quantity
186-out||B, whether A's and B's are functions of the canonical variables, the q's and p's
187-out||which we take over from classical mechanics, then, quantum mechanics will tell you that
188-out||this is greater than or equal to on the right hand side, a certain quantity which is associated
189-out||with A and B. It will turn out to be this is greater than equal to one half the modulus
190-out||of the expectation value of the Poisson bracket of quantum bracket, that is, Poisson bracket
191-out||of A with B, which turns out to be the commutator and I am going to define what it means. So
192-out||that's the general uncertainty principle and this is something we are going to show
193-out||explicitly. When you apply it all the way back to a Cartesian component of position
194-out||and it's canonically conjugate momentum, this right hand side will reduce to h cross
195-out||over two.
196-out||In any case, it's clear that you have the modulus of some number or quantity here or
197-out||some complex number in general, and you have the modulus of it, the modulus cannot be a
198-out||negative number. It could be zero. Now you could ask from where Planck's constant comes
199-out||in. It will generally appear here in the calculation of this object. Occasionally there are cases
200-out||where it would become zero. For example, if you had x with py, this is 0.
201-out||In quantum mechanics, the corresponding term would mean something like delta x delta py
202-out||is greater than 0 or equal to 0. Do we have enough technology such that delta x and delta
203-out||px  is exactly equal to h cross over 2? That's a very good question. Do we have sufficiently
204-out||precise experiments where you could actually take a given particle, take its x component
205-out||of the position and the x component of it's momentum, measure delta x delta p, put it
206-out||in some state and measure this and then discover that delta x delta p is actually equal to
207-out||h cross over two? The answer is yes. That's called the minimum uncertainty state because
208-out||that's the least value the uncertainty could have. In fact, we can go better. Not in terms
209-out||of x and p, but in terms of quantities which satisfy relation similar to that.
210-out||If I schematically plot delta x here with delta p here on this side, these are standard
211-out||deviations so they are not negative numbers. They are both non-negative numbers. If you
212-out||plot this, the minimum uncertainty occurs when delta x delta p is equal to h cross over
213-out||two and what sort of curve is that? It's a rectangular hyperbola because you have x
214-out||y is equal to constant. That's a rectangular hyperbola.
215-out||So, in fact, you have a situation like this. On this curve, you have minimum uncertainty
216-out||in suitable units. If x is length, then p is MLT inverse. So, they don't have the
217-out||same physical dimensions. If you reduce them to both sufficiently dimensionless variables
218-out||by dividing through a momentum scale and dividing by a length scale in the problem, then, it
219-out||will turn out that the symmetric point here, where delta x is equal to delta p, in some
220-out||sense, is the best you can do.
221-out||The optimal thing you can do is to reduce the error in x to the least possible, the
222-out||uncertainty in p to the least possible and that's the least we can do. Such states
223-out||are realizable and we will talk about it in detail. In fact now, technology is such that,
224-out||not in the context of positions of particles, but in the context of quantum optics states
225-out||of the radiation field, where these two quantities are a pair of variables which are analogous
226-out||to x and p; which are the counter parts, you can actually move along this curve here. So
227-out||you could get to a stage when you are here, which implies that delta p is below the uncertainty
228-out||limit but delta x is greater. These are possible and they are called squeezed states. So it
229-out||means that you squeezed the uncertainty in one of them. You are practically going to
230-out||zero but the price you pay is that the uncertainty in the other one increases enormously. Theoretically,
231-out||you could even go down to zero in this case but the other variable would go to infinity.
232-out||Most of the time, the states of the system that you deal with are sitting out here, where
233-out||delta x delta p is greater than h cross over two. This is where the product  is exactly equal to this but you could go
234-out||to this region out to there. In general, that's what happens unless you arrange matters extremely
235-out||carefully.
236-out||So, the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics has nothing to do with the precision we have
237-out||available. Even with the best of precision, the uncertainty principle still operates and
238-out||it says that the product of uncertainties in any variable and its conjugate variable
239-out||has a least possible value. But if the pair of variables is canonically conjugate, classically,
240-out||then this Poisson bracket is not zero. It's equal to 1 and correspondingly, it turns out
241-out||that you have a relation of this kind out here.
242-out||Similarly, delta r delta pr is greater than or equal to h cross over two and so on. The
243-out||crucial thing is that you cannot measure one at one time, another at another time and then
244-out||say that I have accuracy. It must be simultaneous, at the same instant of time. That's not
245-out||possible and it has nothing to do with equipment. It is simply there as fact of nature. The
246-out||problem is you have to put on your quantum thinking cap and think classically. The moment
247-out||you have a relation like this, it implies that you cannot specify x and px to arbitrary
248-out||accuracy. This means that for a particle which obeys quantum mechanics in the phase plane,
249-out||if this is x and px, I cannot say that the position of that state of the particle is
250-out||there.
251-out||I cannot put a point down which flies in the phase of all that we did in the previous course
252-out||where I talked about phase trajectories. The phase trajectory is a phase space point moving
253-out||along and I said the point specifies the state of the system and all the coordinates and
254-out||the all moment are specified. But you cannot do that now because the moment I put a point
255-out||like this it implies that I know both x and px to arbitrary precision. So states of a
256-out||system cannot be any longer represented by points in phase space. We have to replace
257-out||it with something else which obeys the uncertainty principle. Therefore, there is an intrinsic
258-out||fuzziness. You cannot do better than something like this.
259-out||That's the best you can do because you cannot say there is a point in phase space. The moment
260-out||you cannot say there is a point in phase space, as time evolves, you cannot talk about a phase
261-out||trajectory either because the earlier classical picture was that, this point moved around
262-out||as a function of time and gave you a trajectory.
263-out||At every instant of time, you identified a phase space point with the state of the system
264-out||or the particle. You cannot do that now. You have a little fuzzy ball and this fuzzy ball
265-out||is moving around, distorting its shape and you don't know what it's going to do.
266-out||So this entire classical description of particles with specific trajectories goes out of the
267-out||window. You simply cannot talk about it which is why; when you study the hydrogen atom for
268-out||instance, you cannot talk about an orbit for the electron because the moment you say something
269-out||is orbiting, you have immediately told me its position and its momentum.
270-out||Because if you write down an orbit, here is a center of attraction and here is an orbit,
271-out||then at this instant of time you said this is the position with respect to the center
272-out||of attraction and the tangent here will give you the direction of the momentum. You multiply
273-out||the velocity by the mass and you get the momentum. This is not possible. So the idea of orbits
274-out||is gone completely. It may be a very convenient picturisation even in quantum mechanics under
275-out||certain circumstances but the fact of the matter is electrons don't have orbits.
# 
277-out||we can possibly think of measuring it experimentally. Does this property arise because particles
278-out||have dimensions? No, it's not because particles have dimensions. That's a good question
279-out||he says you cannot specify a given point maybe because it's got a finite extent no. Even
280-out||if it were a point particle, even if it were a mathematical ideal point mass, this is true.
281-out||So it has nothing to do with finite extent of the particle. It is an intrinsic property.
282-out||That's the way it is. So we can no longer speak about orbits. In quantum chemistry,
283-out||one is used to talking about molecular orbital theory. The s orbitals, p orbitals, pi orbitals
284-out||and so on. They are convenient picturizations. That's not the way the electron actually
285-out||behaves in an atom. For instance, when you do the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, you
286-out||are told that in the ground state of the hydrogen atom, the orbital distance is one times the
287-out||Bohr radius and it's moving in a circular orbit. That cannot be true.
288-out||Because if that were true, you have this particle here with the center of attraction O and something
289-out||moving at the Bohr radius a0, the orbital angular momentum of this particle about the
290-out||center of attraction cannot be zero. It's not going through the particle at all. So
291-out||you calculate r cross p, it's supposed to be uniform circular motion and of course,
292-out||the orbital angular momentum is non-zero. But at the same breath you are told that in
293-out||the ground state of the hydrogen atom, l = 0.You have the hydrogen atom in which you described
294-out||the state of the electron by a principle quantum number m, orbital angular momentum quantum
295-out||number l and the magnetic quantum number m, then in the ground state i.e. the lowest energy
296-out||state, n = 1, l = 0 and m = 0.
297-out||And you are also told that if you look at the component of the orbital angular momentum
298-out||perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, it's l times h cross. But if l is 0, that is zero.
299-out||That cannot be true if it's orbiting at a finite distance. So that alone should tell
300-out||you that this picture is wrong immediately. This is certainly true but they cannot be
301-out||supported by a picture of this kind. On the other hand, it is true that if I calculate
302-out||the average distance or the most probable distance, is in fact a zero. But that's
303-out||a statistical and a quantum mechanical average here.
304-out||So the real fact of the matter is that the electron does not have a position and a conjugate
305-out||momentum simultaneously. It is not a point particle in that classical sense of the word.
306-out||You have to get out of this classical way of thinking. In some kind of crazy extended
307-out||object, you need something to describe it by what's called as the state of the system,
308-out||the state vector which is a generalization of the wave function. We will discuss it in
309-out||great detail and I will tell you how the state vector is defined and how to calculate its
310-out||properties here. As far as I am concerned that's what the electron is in reality.
311-out||I don't answer questions like is it a wave, is it a particle, is it a particle on some
312-out||days and a particle on another days etc. These are terms which are meaningless when you apply
313-out||it in the context of quantum mechanical particles. The failure is not on the part of the quantum
314-out||mechanical particle. The failure is not on the part of the experimentalist. The failure
315-out||is on the part of the English language. Words like wave particle and so on have been coined
316-out||by us to paraphrase a set of properties. These properties are the properties of objects with
317-out||which we have daily experienced. And then when you say a particle in the mental picture,
318-out||you have a particle like a billiard ball, a hard rigid object, very compact, sometimes
319-out||idealized even to a point, massive, something which is localized, carries energy, momentum
320-out||and so on. On the other hand, the word wave is mentally based on our experience with them
321-out||in nature which we see around us like water waves or sound waves.
322-out||These are diffused objects that are not localized. They don't have rigid boundaries. They are
323-out||not hard. They are smooth, gently undulating everywhere, delocalized in space and time
324-out||etc. they carry wavelength, frequency and properties of that kind. We put all classical
325-out||objects into these two bins. One of them would consist of particles which are compact, localized,
326-out||hard objects, carrying properties like energy, momentum etc and the other is waves which
327-out||carry properties like wavelength, frequency etc. they are delocalized extended objects.
328-out||And we know that in daily life, these are mutually exclusive. The wave is not a particle;
329-out||the particle is not a wave. We can see and measure properties and decide whether it is
330-out||falls in this basket or the other basket.
331-out||What we shouldn't do is to extrapolate this categorization of objects into waves and particles
332-out||to the microscopic domain because in that domain it is conceivable that there exist
333-out||objects which have some of these properties and some of those properties. It's also
334-out||conceivable that we have objects which have these properties or those properties depending
335-out||on how you probe them or how you measure these properties. That's what happens for electrons
336-out||or microscopic particles. So the failure is not on the part of the electron or on the
337-out||part of our ability to probe nature. It's a semantic failure. We shouldn't use terms
338-out||which are mutually exclusive sets of properties in the macroscopic world to describe the microscopic
339-out||world.
340-out||If you understand that, there is no wave particle duality mystery. It is just that this description
341-out||fails completely and you need a better description. It so happens, not unfortunately but fortunately
342-out||that the description is not in terms of ordinary language. It is intrinsically mathematical
343-out||and that's the language you need to describe these objects in. It's completely unambiguous.
344-out||It's just that you cannot put it back in the normal words to 100% because these words
345-out||have been coined by us to understand the world of macroscopic phenomenon. This is the reason
346-out||why we need mathematics. Therefore, the question of something being physical and something
347-out||being unphysical or purely mathematical, if I say it in equations shouldn't be there.
348-out||It is just that the words are insufficient. Hence we took a longtime to recognize this
349-out||but once you recognize it, it's like learning another language and that's the appropriate
350-out||language for it. It's not that we haven't coined enough words for this. It's not that
351-out||either because you will just be coining arbitrary words to translate mathematical terms into
352-out||this. it's not that at all it's not that the language doesn't have enough words is
353-out||nothing much is gained if I say something which is neither a wave nor a particle is
354-out||a wavicle [Noise] that's being used in the in the literature people have said this nothing
355-out||is gained by it
356-out||I would rather say that is it's a state vector. In fact it's much more precise that
357-out||way. Its not just at the level of semantics alone. It goes much deeper than that. The
358-out||fundamental thing about quantum mechanics will come out in the fact that, even ordinary
"359-out||words like ""and"" and ""or"" have different meanings in classical and quantum physics,"
"360-out||and you have to get used to it. If you think a little bit about it, the word ""and"""
361-out||in ordinary language is always with respect to multiplication of probabilities. You want
"362-out||this to happen and that to happen, then the probability is multiply. The word ""or"""
363-out||is always with respect to addition of probabilities. You have two mutually exclusive possibilities
364-out||and you want this or that to happen, the total probability is addition. So I would like to
"365-out||say that ""or"" means addition and ""and"" means multiply. That's the classical way"
366-out||of looking at it. In quantum mechanics the same thing is true except it's not true
367-out||for probabilities but for objects called probability amplitudes. So it's even a change of classical
368-out||probability. Quantum mechanics could be looked at as a change in the rules of classical probability
369-out||completely.
370-out||Now, of course the immediate hard question that arises is when does something stop being
371-out||quantum mechanical and start being classical? I know that a single electron is obviously
372-out||a quantum mechanical object. Ten electrons are still quantum mechanical. A molecule is
373-out||quantum mechanical. On the other hand, a piece of chalk looks classical which can be describes
374-out||by classical physics. So when does it stop? Is there some sharp boundary? The answer is
375-out||no. there is no sharp boundary. This is not a question of whether there is a precise boundary
376-out||between classical and quantum physics. It's just that, as you go towards the quantum domain
377-out||from the classical domain, the quantum corrections to classical physics become more and more
378-out||significant. Then it's a question of what accuracy you want. There will be a stage when
379-out||the classical description breaks down completely. There is no smooth boundary at all. It's
380-out||a much diffused boundary. This is like some of these paintings you see. You start with
381-out||red on the right hand side and blue on the left hand side and as you go, there is no
382-out||sharp boundary. It's just that things become bluer as you move to the left and right. Eventually
383-out||there is no red. Everything is blue. It's in the same sense the classical quantum boundary
384-out||is diffused. It's not a sharp boundary. So all the quantum phenomena when started
385-out||with something fully quantum mechanical will start becoming more and more classical as
386-out||you move towards the classical region. But I must say here that classical mechanics is
387-out||an approximation to quantum mechanics not the other way around. The more fundamental
388-out||theory is quantum mechanics and classical mechanics is a limiting case, an approximation
389-out||to it. Just as relativistic physics is believed by us to be the right formalism and non-relativistic
390-out||physics are an approximation when v over c becomes negligible and so on.
391-out||It's exactly in the same way because Planck's constant is not zero but when the effects
392-out||that you are looking at or in some sense much bigger than Planck's constant then you would
393-out||say it's a in the classical region. Can you have quantum formalism without a classical
394-out||formalism at all? This is again a very deep question and the answer is, it looks like
395-out||no. you cannot. And it's different from relativity because it's conceivable that
396-out||you live in a universe where everything moves at speeds comparable to the speed of light
397-out||in vacuum. You don't have a non-relativistic region at all. It's conceivable and it will
398-out||be perfectly consistent. But the very interpretation of quantum mechanics, by us at least, because
399-out||we have macroscopic objects, looks like you need to have a classical limit. Otherwise
400-out||the interpretation becomes meaningless. But I don't know the deep answer to the question
401-out||of is it consistent to have a universe in which you have only quantum physics and no
402-out||classical region at all. But for us it's a mood point. The reason is we are large objects
403-out||and we are in the classical region in many respects. Therefore, for us to be able to
404-out||probe that universe of quantum physics and understand it, it looks likes it's essential
405-out||for us to have a classical limit. The very meaning of words like measurement, recording,
406-out||observation, etc is intrinsically classical notions. So it looks like we need it. But
407-out||whether it's consistent to have a fully quantum universe is not known.
408-out||Sir, today there are so many developments? Why don't we have quantum gravity? Why is
409-out||this theory so distinct and complicated? We don't know. There are deep reasons as to
410-out||why we have to go far down into length scales and time scales and so on, before you see
411-out||the effects of quantum gravity. The reason for it is simply that since we are spending
412-out||time talking about deep problems today, let's continue with that. You see the fundamental
413-out||constants of nature that we know about, are not constants in mass, length and time. That's
414-out||not the way the universe is built.
415-out||It turns out that what we have available to us in the universe is a quantum of action,
416-out||h; a c and Newton's gravitational constant G. These are the fundamental constants of
417-out||nature. These are the most basic constants of nature. Actually, there are just two of
418-out||them. We could really say h cross and c. we could set equal one and say they are fundamental.
419-out||These are really basic choice of units and there is only G. but quite apart from that,
420-out||you have these three fundamental constants of nature. You can construct from them, quantities
421-out||of dimensions; mass, length and time, by taking suitable combinations of h, c and G. So I
422-out||request to do this. In combinations of h to the power alpha, G to the power beta, c to
423-out||the power gamma, find alpha, beta and gamma such that, you get a length or a mass or a
424-out||time and these are the Planck mass, Planck length, Planck time, etc.
425-out||Now clearly, those would be the natural length scales and time scales, when gravity as well
426-out||as quantum mechanics will play a role because gravity is represented by this and quantum
427-out||mechanics by that. And it turns out that the length scale that you talk about, l Planck,
428-out||lp is of the order of ten to the power minus thirty five meters. That's the way these
429-out||numbers are in our universe. The Planck time tp is of the order of 10 to the power - 42
430-out||seconds. This is the reason why we don't know what's happening below that. Because
431-out||concepts like length, time and so on may not even be definable continuously up to zero,
432-out||below these lengths scales and time scales. So the problem of quantizing gravity, which
433-out||is what I presumed you are referring to, is a difficult one. We don't know what goes
434-out||on there. part of the difficulty is that, even concepts like length, mass and time,
435-out||length and time in particular or space time, whether it's continuous all the way down
436-out||to zero or not, we don't know because the laws of physics, as we know today, don't
437-out||presumably operate below this. So we don't know what replaces it. This is the difficulty.
438-out||There are other technical difficulties in quantizing gravity and so on. The fundamental
439-out||difficulty is simply that our notion of space-time breaks down.
440-out||You said that the semantics is not enough. Are we sure that the mathematics is enough?
441-out||well, to the extent that, if you make a set of postulates based on some observations which
442-out||could not be explained by classical physics, this is how quantum mechanics was initially
443-out||put in, and then you ask what are it's predictions, what are the results of it's calculations
444-out||and then you observe once again, do those experiments and test it out and so on, you
445-out||are testing this theory and this formalism and the mathematics associated with it. It
446-out||looks like there are no violations, as far as we know. But you can never prove a physical
447-out||theory to 100% accuracy. It doesn't exist. There will be a domain where it might perhaps
448-out||breakdown at some stage. We don't know at the moment. Now as to whether the mathematics
449-out||is sufficient, as far as we know, yes this is sufficient but we don't know what happens
450-out||when you go to these regions.
451-out||When you go to quantum field theory, when you include relativity, general relativity
452-out||plus quantum mechanics and then try to do make calculations, even the formalism of quantum
453-out||field theory breaks down. It yields nonsense. You have to replace it with some other formalism.
454-out||There are many candidates, one of which is called string theory. Another one called loop
455-out||gravity, quantum gravity and so on. But these are at a very deep conceptual level. Its very
456-out||likely that this problem 
457-out||that our present understanding of space-time itself as well as our understanding of quantum
458-out||mechanics will undergo drastic revisions before we solve this problem. The answer is sort
459-out||of not well established. The answer is that it looks like we have not succeeded with existing
460-out||technology. Now it's purely mathematical. The indications are the technical difficulties
461-out||that arise in this program and they suggest that our very ideas of space- time, what we
462-out||mean by dimension, etc, as well as what we mean by normal quantum mechanics I think,
463-out||will undergo drastic revision. So it's a house under construction. It looks like the
464-out||existing frame work is not powerful enough to do this.
465-out||You could ask now what about experiment. That we lag far behind. The shortest distances
466-out||we can probe are of the order of ten to the power minus seventeen or eighteen. This is
467-out||all we have been able to probe so far in the highest energy accelerators. There are sixteen
468-out||orders of magnitude or seventeen orders of magnitude between these two. We don't know
469-out||what hat can happen in there.
470-out||Similarly, the shortest length scales we have been able to probe which are of the order
471-out||of 10 to the -- 23 seconds. There are twenty orders of magnitude in between. We don't
472-out||know how things will change. So we keep an open mind completely. That's the whole point
473-out||about physics. It's not mathematics. So it is not a set of axioms from which you derive
474-out||results. The rules of the game we are prepared to change and subsume in an even broader frame
475-out||work and then say what we did so far is a special case, a limiting case, etc and try
476-out||to increase the range of applicability of whatever theory you have.
477-out||So in that sense, there is no dogma completely open to it. But people have been thinking
478-out||very hard for many years now. Physics is four hundred years old in its modern form and in
479-out||the last hundred years, of course it really accelerated. But one thing is for sure that,
480-out||just as Newtonian mechanics is now known to be an appropriate approximation under certain
481-out||circumstances, so is it true that today's quantum mechanics and our calculational tools
482-out||will be applicable in a certain region of physical parameters. The understanding of
483-out||why this is so should get deeper, broader and so on. The understanding of why this is
484-out||an approximation, why it works in this range and not in some other range will become sharper.
485-out||But I think some fundamental issues themselves will become clearer namely; what's the meaning
486-out||of space time, what determines the dimensions of space-time, what's this business about
487-out||gravity, what are the fundamental forces of nature and so on.
488-out||After all, it's a sobering thought that we don't know 95% of the constituents of
489-out||our own universe. We can only explain 5% of it  in terms of matter. After so many millennia
490-out||of astronomy and the real explosion in the last 50 years or so, the conclusion is that
491-out||we really don't know 95% of our own universe and we don't know if it is one of an infinite
492-out||number of possible universes. So it's just that like Wheeler said our knowledge is like
493-out||an island and the boundary of this island is, of course the frontier of ignorance. So
494-out||the island is getting bigger all the time but then its parameter is also increasing.
495-out||The level of ignorance is also increasing at the same time. May be they will work but
496-out||we have to keep trying.
497-out||I should end by what Hilbert said in 1900 when he gave these famous twenty three unsolved
498-out||problems in mathematics in The International Congress of Mathematicians. He listed what
499-out||was then, the major unsolved problem, of which today, only the Riemann Hypothesis remains
500-out||unproved. Everything else has been taken care of, one way or another. Some of them are not
501-out||problems. One of them was the axiomatization of physics. Could all of physics we written
502-out||in terms of a set of axioms? The answer to that is no. Physics is not axiomatizable.
503-out||But he made the statement and then it looked like there was a lot of problem ahead and
504-out||so on, but he made a very optimistic statement. So I think one should have this note of optimism.
505-out||It is essential for us to be curious. many reasons why it's not part of the reason
506-out||is simply that all physical laws, as far as we know, apply in certain regions of physical
507-out||parameters and when you go out of that, it's a different set of rules.
508-out||Looks like it's very general but its interpretation and the way it's set up is not satisfying.
509-out||So it already looks like there are big black boxes in it which we have pushed under the
510-out||rug but they exist nevertheless. We have not understood quantum non-locality. Except in
511-out||some mathematical form of a framework, we prove our satisfaction. It really hasn't
512-out||come to grips with the meaning of measurement. Now what happens to a system when you measure
513-out||it? So there are large gaps conceptual gaps here. So it's clear it's an incomplete
514-out||theory in that sense at least that understanding is not as deep as we would like it to be the
515-out||framework of quantum mechanics. You could ask may be this is the best you can do how
516-out||do you know we don't know that too we don't know but we have to keep pushing so today
517-out||has been a sort of general talk. We will start of with some specific issues and so on next time.
